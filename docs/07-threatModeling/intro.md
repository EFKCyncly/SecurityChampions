# What is Threat Modeling? 

Threat modeling is a structured, repeatable process used to gain actionable insights into the security characteristics of a particular system. It's an important concept for modern application developers to understand. 

1. **What is threat modeling?** Threat modeling is a method for identifying possible vulnerabilities in an application's architecture in advance. It involves diagramming an application, identifying security flaws, and mitigating those flaws. 

2. **Why threat model?** Threat modeling seeks to identify potential security issues during the design phase, allowing security to be "built-into" a system rather than "bolted-on". This is far more efficient than hacing to identify and resolve security flaws after a system is in production. It also increases security awareness and provides improved visibility into a system and its interactions.

3. **Threat modeling process** The threat modeling process can be decomposed into four high-level steps: 
    - **Scope your work** Gain an understanding of what you're working on. This can involve drawing diagrams often data flow diagrams, identifying entry points, and identifying "assets".

    - **Identify Threats:** Determine the threats that could potentially harm your application.

    - **Determine countermeasures and mitigation** Decide on the measures to counteract or mitigate the identified threats.

    - **Assess your work** Evaluate the effectiveness of your threat modeling and the countermeasures implemented

Remember threat modeling is ideally performed early in the software development life cycle (SDLC), such as during the design phase. It should be maintained, updated, and refined alongside the system.
