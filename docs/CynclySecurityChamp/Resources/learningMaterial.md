Portswigger is the creators of [Burp suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) which is a free penetration tool used to penetration test web apps. When we order penetration test on Cyncly's web apps there is a high likelyhood that the consultants use this tool to test our web applications. Burpsuite is also used by adversaries to look for vulnerabilities to be used for malicious intent as gaining access to confidential data. 

    Therefore learning about burp suite and understanding how an attacker thinks can greatly increase our security mindset while developing web applications. PortSwigger has a great seb security academy which is free and we highly encourage you to take a look at it.
