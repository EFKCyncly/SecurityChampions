No matter how well you prepare, there will always be situatios where things go wrong. Preparedness is about having plans for how to react when something unexpected happens: 

- "Do we have backup of the database\s?"
- "Have we tested it?"
- "What do we do if we detect unwanted activity in our systems?"
- "What do we do if sensitive information leaks from our systems?"

When things go wrong, it's important to react quickly, and if you don't already have routines in place, you lose valuable time. It is imporant that you know where to find the necessary information and who to contact to get answers to things you may not have an overview of yourself. These routines must be practiced and, if necessary, adjusted at regular intervals. 

The framework for emergency preparedness in Cyncly describes how we will organise, manage and evaluate emergency incidents. The goal is to have an emergency response organistation that is proactive, professional and that provides the necessary decision support.
