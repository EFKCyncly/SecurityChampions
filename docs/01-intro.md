## About Security Champion

Development teams are encouraged to designate one or more individuals to assume the role of a security Champion. In case there are numerous small teams that support a particular domain, it is advisable for that domain to be represented by at least one Security Champion. 

What is a security champion: A team member who elevates the importance of security within the team. 
This role involves serving as the team’s “security conscience.” Expertise in security is not a prerequisite for becoming a Security Advocate; a keen interest in security matters is sufficient.

-	Engaging with the security champion community
-	Assisting in threat modeling exercises 
-	Performing and/or confirming the results of automated security scans 
-	Acting as the primary liaison for security inquiries

## About the network

Purpose of the security champions network is designed to foster a sense of community among security champions at Cyncly. The Landscape of software development has shifted significantly in recent years, transitioning from large teams with numerous developers to the smaller, self-sufficient teams we see today. These modern DevOps teams are now entrusted with the full lifecycle of applications, including the aspect of security. 
The inception of this network is a direct response to the need for a proactive approach to security-emphasizing the need for skill development within developer teams. As the network expands, our ambition is for it to become a central hub of knowledge and expertise in application security within Cyncly, offering a platform for teams to share their triumphs and challenges, thereby fostering mutual learning. 


### Network Goals 

Our aim is to cultivate an active and vibrant community, across cultures and borders to bring together collective learning across Cyncly, and increasing Cyncly’s applications security. 

### Network Activites

Activities may include:
-	Weekly morning coffee meeting (per office/global online) 
-	Monthly virtual gatherings for the network, featuring presentations and in-depth discussions on various topics. (here Security champions can share  their experiences and insights.)
-	Once network is fully operational, we aim to organize 1-2 in-person meetups annually for all Security Champions
